FlipSide A.E. is the ultimate Audio Encoder GUI.  It was designed to take the place of encoder front ends
that are less flexable/not being developed/just plain suck.  FlipSide A.E. uses add-ons to interface with the
actual encoders.  The add-ons are relitively easy and small chunks of C++ code that tell FlipSide A.E. the 
Name of the encoder, the possible settings (presented in a menu), and an output file name pattern.  The
user's preferred settings are saved on a <i>per add-on</i> basis.  This allows the add-ons to offer very
specific settings for their encoder, and allows the user to save off their ogg encoded files in one directory
with a particular naming scheme, and their mp3's in another directory with a completely different naming
scheme.  The GUI was built with keyboard naviagtion as a high priority, which makes entering of data much
easier than with some of it's competitors.  If you are encoding a CD, FlipSide A.E. recognizes cddblinkd
renaming scheme, and sets the attributes accordingly.  FlipSide A.E. is fully drag-n-drop aware, so grab your
favorite audio file, and drop it on FlipSide A.E. to enjoy the benefits of its add-on based architecture.
FlipSide A.E. provides you with an "Encoding Finished" sound event that you can set so FlipSide A.E. notifies
you when encoding is finished.  FlipSide A.E. was designed with the user's experience in mind.  If you find
something that doesn't seem right, it probably isn't.  Drop us a line, and we'll do what we can to rectify
it, however keep in mind that there are many ways to attack the same problem, and just because one way seems
reasonable to you, a great many others may not feel the same.  That being said, let's get one with the basics.

I won't waste your time explaining the About and Quit menu choices.  You can figure them out for yourselves.
The Load CD submenu is a great little feature that lists all currently mounted Audio CD's.  It will autoupdate
itself whenever a CD is mounted, unmounted, or renamed.  Selecting a CD from this submenu will add all the 
tracks on the CD to the list (actually the wav representations of the tracks). Also this seems as good of a time
as any to mention that FlipSide A.E. is fully drag-n-drop aware, and you can drop any type of audio file on it to
add it to the file list.

Again, the three choices are pretty self-explanitory.  Select All selects all the items in the list, Deselect
All unselects all the items in the list, and Remove removes all selected items from the list.  I'll mention
here that whenever unmounting a CD that has items displayed in the list, those items will automagicly
disappear.  If you delete a file that is in the list, it will also automagicly be removed from the list.  A
word of caution:  Deleteing a file that is in the list or umounting a cd that has files in the list will cause
encoding to automaticly cancel, and present you with an alert explaining that a file in the list has just disapeared
from the earth.  This is for the safety of you, your machine, your family, and the annoying neighbor next door.

Currently there are 10 columns that are displayed in the File List. Of those 10, 9 are hideable.  These 9 are
represented with entries in the Columns menu.  Of course you are also supplied with keyboard shortcuts to
hide/show each particular column. (Just in case you care, the 10th column is the status column that displays
a red checkmark when encoding of that item has completed.)

Now we're getting to the fun stuff.  This menu is based on the contents of
&lt;FLIPSIDE A.E. INSTALL DIR&gt;/add-ons.  Any FlipSide A.E. add-ons that reside in that directory will
automagicly be added to this menu.  This menu will autoupdate itself whenever an add-on is added/removed
from the add-ons directory.  The encoder selected by this menu will display a menu just to the right of
the Encoder menu, with a label identical to it's label in the Encoder menu.

There is actually no menu called "Encoder Settings", it's just a generic term used to describe the menu just
to the right of the Encoder menu.  The contents of this menu are based entirely on the selected encoder
add-on, so trying to discribe anything here would be stupid.  I'll just make a couple of generic comments
here.  The encoder may choose to not provide a menu, so there may not be anything here.  The second comment is
that your choices on this menu are saved each time you select a different encoder, and when FlipSide A.E.
exits.

This is also fun stuff.  The contents of the text field are saved on a <i>per add-on</i> basis just like the
<a href="#EncoderSettings">Encoder Settings</a> menu.  There are seven variables available to you when
editing this field.  They correspond to the seven Audio attributes that FlipSide A.E. understands
(artist, album, title, year, comment, track, genre).  This allows you to save files to a path that varies
with the artist or album, and allows you to construct file names that are based on the attributes of the file.
The first time you use a particular add-on, it will supply what the author believes to be a reasonable default,
or at least a good suggestion to give you ideas on how to use it.  This pattern is strictly used to determine
the file name for the output file.

This is cool. Check it out.  One of the great features about FlipSide A.E. is the excellent keyboard navigation. 
Starting with version 1.0.7, FlipSide A.E. provides some extra shortcuts for us keyboard addicted folk.  Try these:

<blockquote>
Alt-E  This changes the focus to the Details Editor.<br>
Alt-F  This one changes the focus to the File Path and Name Pattern editor.<br>
Alt-L  This will set the focus on the List.<br>

This is the tool that allows you to edit the attributes associated with each file.  I use the word attribute
loosely here as the add-ons are not required to write attributes out (sometimes it doesn't make sense), nor are
you required to edit them. Just be aware that if you use variables in your pattern, and don't supply the
attributes, your output file names could collide, in which case, the last one encoded wins. (Although having
mulitiple files with the same output file isn't always bad. See M3U Creator documentation for an example.)
<br>
<br>
The check boxes turn the text fields/pick list on and off.  If a control is on when the Apply button is invoked,
then the value will be copied over to the correct attribue column for the selected files.  The genre pick list
contains all of the ID3 v1.1 genres. This does not stop you from creating your own genres however.  Just type 
what you like in the genre text field.  When sending information to the add-on, FlipSide A.E. sends both the 
text version of the genre and the ID3 v1.1 genre id.  If the text genre is not one in the list of ID3 v1.1
genres, it will send the correct text, and the genre id for "Other".  It is then up to the add-on to decide
what to do with the information (if it does anything with it at all).

The file list is one of the cooler features of FlipSide A.E.  When you press the encoding button, FlipSide A.E.
takes a snapshot of what's in the File List, and encodes them in the order that they appear.  You may sort,
reorder the columns, or resize the columns at any time.  FlipSide A.E.  will save which columns are shown,
their size and order, and sorting preferences when quit.  All of the things you would expect from a first
rate BeOS application.

Brian Tietz's (briant@timelinevista.com) excellent Santa's Gift Bag was used for the File List.  Please give him
a warm round of applause for developing quite possibly the most useful set of 3rd party classes for BeOS on the 
face of the planet (and beyond).
<br>
<br>
Matt Verran (M on BeShare) donated his very good artistic abilities in creating FlipSide A.E.'s icon.  Next time
you're in BeShare, give him a well deserved pat on the back.
<br>
<br>
I'd also like to thank the rest of the folks on BeShare that helped test the Release Canidates for FlipSide A.E.
My hat's off to you.  You're a great bunch of people!
